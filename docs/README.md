# Setup & Use

*ursa* is a set of minimal scripts with the least number of external dependencies, most of which it sets up by itself to be able to perform its operations. These operations include regular backups, updates, data-refresh, and eventual data retrieval by a trusted family member or inheritor.

The docs have been organized into the following three phases:

1. [Setting up *ursa*](./01-setup.md) that is a one-time setup
2. [Regular backups](./02-regular-backups.md) by the owner
3. [Data retrieval](./03-data-retrieval.md) by the inheritor
